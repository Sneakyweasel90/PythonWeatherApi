This was a Python application made with the help of BroCode from Youtube. I have created APIs in the past but not with Python

# IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS PLEASE MAKE A .ENV FILE AND PLACE IN API_KEY={YOUR API KEY HERE}
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
# IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS PLEASE MAKE A .ENV FILE AND PLACE IN API_KEY={YOUR API KEY HERE}
